ENCODExplorer: A compilation of metadata from ENCODE
====================================================================

"The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium is an international 
collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research 
Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of 
functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the 
protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and 
circumstances in which a gene is active"[source: [ENCODE Projet Portal](https://www.encodeproject.org/)] .

However, data retrieval and downloading can be really time consuming using 
current web portal, especially with multiple files from different experiments.

This package has been designed to facilitate the data access by compiling the 
metadata associated with file, experiment, dataset, biosample, and treatment. 

We first extract ENCODE schema from its public github repository to rebuild 
the ENCODE database into a data.table database. Thanks to this package, the user 
will be enable to generate, store and query ENCODE database locally. We also 
developped a function which can extract the essential metadata in a R object to 
aid data exploration.

We implemented time-saving features to select ENCODE files by querying their 
metadata, downloading them and validating that the file was correctly
downloaded.

The data.table database can be regenerated at will to keep it up-to-date.

This vignette will introduce all the main features of the ENCODExplorer package.

### Loading ENCODExplorer package

```{r libraryLoad, warning=FALSE}
library(ENCODExplorer)
```

### Introduction

Up to date, there are 7 types of dataset in ENCODE : annotation, experiment, 
matched-set, project, reference, reference-epigenome and ucsc-browser-composite.
This package comes with an up-to-date  `data.table` containing the essential
of ENCODE files metadata: `encode_df`. This database contains all the files within all dataset type.
The accession column corresponds to the accession of the dataset and the file_accession
column corresponds to the actual accession of the file.
The `encode_df` object is **mandatory** for the functions provided in this package.
Most of the provided functions will load `encode_df` as default database. For
faster processing, we recommend the user to load `encode_df` and pass it as an argument.

To load `encode_df` :
```{r load_encodeDF, collapse=TRUE}
    data(encode_df, package = "ENCODExplorer")
```


In the current release, `encode_df` contains 138578 entries of which 133103 coming from the experiment dataset.

### Main functions

#### Query

The `queryEncode` function allows the user to find the subset of files corresponding to
a precise query defined according to the following criteria :

|Parameter| Description|
|---------|-------------|
|set_accession|The experiment or dataset accession|
|assay|The assay type|
|biosample_name|The biosample name|
|dataset_accession|There is a subtle difference between the parameters **set_accession** and **dataset_accession**. In fact, some files can be part of experiment, dataset orboth. When using **set_accession**, you will get all the files directly linked withthis accession (experiment and/or dataset). While the usage of **dataset_accesstion** will get the files directly link to the requested dataset **AND** those which are part of an experiment and indirectly link to a dataset (reported as related files in the dataset and related_dataset in experiment).|
|file_accession|The file accesion|
|file_format|The current version of encode_df contains the following file format : *bam*, *bed*, *fastq*, *bigBed*, *bigWig*, *CEL*, *csfasta*, *csqual*, *fasta*, *gff*, *gtf*, *idat*, *rcc*, *sam*, *tagAlign*, *tar*, *tsv*, *vcf*, *wig*.|
|lab|The laboratory|
|organism|The donor organism|
|target|The experimental target|
|treatment|The treatment related to the biosample|
|project|The project name/id|
|biosample_name|The biosample name|
|biosample_type|The biosample type|


By default, the query function uses the exact string matching to perform the selection of 
the relevant entries. This behavior can be changed by setting the `fixed` option 
to **FALSE**.

The structure of the result set is similar to the `encode_df` table.

For example, to select all the fastq files produced on human
cell MCF-7:
```{r query_results, collapse=TRUE}
print(queryEncode(df=encode_df, organism = "Homo sapiens",
                      biosample_name = "MCF-7", file_format = "fastq", fixed = TRUE))
```

The same request with approximate spelling of the biosample name and `fixed` option
to `TRUE`, will give no results :
```{r query_results_2, collapse=TRUE}
query_results <- queryEncode(df=encode_df, organism = "Homo sapiens",
                       biosample_name = "mcf7", file_format = "fastq", fixed = TRUE)
```

If you follow the warning guidance and set the `fixed` option to FALSE:
```{r query_results_3, collapse=TRUE}
query_results <- queryEncode(df=encode_df, organism = "Homo sapiens",
                    biosample_name = "mcf7", file_format = "fastq", fixed = FALSE)
```

These criteria correspond to the filters that you can find on ENCODE portal :

#### fuzzySearch
This function is a more user-friendly version of `queryEncode` function that also perform a search on the `encode_df` object. The character vector or the list of character specified by the user will be searched in every column of the database.The user can also constrain the query by selecting the specific column in which you want to search for the query term with the `filterVector` parameter. 

The following request will produce a data.table with every files that contain
the term *brca*.
```{r fuzzy_results, collapse=TRUE}
fuzzy_results <- fuzzySearch(searchTerm = c("brca"), database = encode_df)
```

Multiple terms can be search at the same time, this example will extract all the
files that contain brca or ZNF24 within the *target* column. 
```{r fuzzy_results_2, collapse=TRUE}
fuzzy_results <- fuzzySearch(searchTerm = c("brca", "ZNF24"), database = encode_df, filterVector = c("target"), multipleTerm = TRUE)
```

When searching for multiple terms, three type of input can be pass to the `searchTerm` parameter :
- Single character with comma between the terms
- Character vector
- List of characters

#### Search
This function simulates a key word search that the user could perform through the
ENCODE web portal.

The `searchEncode` function returns a `data frame` which corresponds to the result page
provided by ENCODE portal. If a specific file or dataset isn't available with 
`fuzzySearch` or `queryEncode` (i.e. within `encode_df`), the user can access  to the latest data of ENCODE database with the searchEncode function.

Look for `searchToquery` to convert the result of a search to a `data.table` with the same design as `encode_df`. This format contain more metadatas and allow the user to extract all the files within the dataset. This format also allow the user to access to control files with the `createDesign` function.

Here is the example of the following search : *"a549 chip-seq homo sapiens"*.

On ENCODE portal :

![results of a key word search on ENCODE portal](img/search_a549.png)

With our function :
```{r search_results, collapse=TRUE}
  search_results <- searchEncode(searchTerm = "a549 chip-seq homo sapiens",
                                 limit = "all")
```

#### createDesign

This function organize the `data.table` created by `fuzzySearch`, `queryEncode` or `searchToquery`. It extract the replicate and control files within a dataset.

It create a `data.table` with the file accessions, the dataset accessions and numeric value associate with the nature of the file (1:replicate / 2:control) when the `format` parameter is set to `long`.

By setting the `format` parameter to `wide`, each dataset will have his own column like the illustraded below.

#### downloadEncode

Allow the user to download a file or an entire dataset. Downloading file can be done by providing a vector of file accessions or dataset accessions  (accession column in `encode_df`) to the `file_acc` parameter.
This parameter can also be the `data.table` created by `queryEncode`, `fuzzySearch`, `searchToquery` or `createDesign`.

If the accession doesn't exist within the actual `encode_df` database, the function will search the accession directly in the ENCODE database.
The user can specify the path to the download directory 
(default: `/tmp`).

To ensure the file integrity, we conduct a check md5 sum 
comparison for each file.

Moreover, if the accession is a dataset accession, the function will download each file in this dataset. The format option, which is set by default to all, enables to download a specific format.

Here is a small query:

```{r query_results_4, collapse=TRUE}
query_results <- queryEncode(df=encode_df, assay = "switchgear", target ="elavl1", fixed = FALSE)
```

And its equivalent search:

```{r search_results_2, collapse=TRUE}
search_results <- searchEncode(searchTerm = "switchgear elavl1", limit = "all")
```

To select a particular file format you can:

1)  add filters to your query and then run the `downloadEncode` function.

```{r query_results_5, collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
query_results <- queryEncode(df=encode_df, assay = "switchgear", target ="elavl1", file_format = "bed" , fixed = FALSE)
downloadEncode(query_results, df = encode_df)
```

2) specify the format to the `downloadEncode` function.

```{r collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
downloadEncode(search_results, df=encode_df, format = "bed")
```


#### Conversion
The function `searchToquery` enables to convert the result of `searchEncode` to a `queryEncode` output based on the accession numbers. Thus the user can benefit from all the collected metadata and the `createDesign` function.

The structure of the result set is similar to the `encode_df` structure.

Let's try it with the previous example :

1) search 

```{r search_results_3, collapse=TRUE}
search_results <- searchEncode(searchTerm = "switchgear elavl1", limit = "all")
```

2) convert
```{r convert_results_1, collapse=TRUE}
convert_results <- searchToquery(searchResults = search_results)
```


#### shinyEncode
This function launch the shinyApp of ENCODExplorer that implements `fuzzySearch` 
and `queryEncode` research functions. It also allows to create a design to organize data and download specific files with `downloadEncode` function. 
The Search tab of shinyEncode applies the `fuzzySearch` function for a low specificity request and the `Advanced Search` tab applies the `queryEncode` function.
